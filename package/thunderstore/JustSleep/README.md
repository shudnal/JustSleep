# JustSleep
Sleep in not owned beds. Sleep in front of the fire.

## Features
Allows you to sleep in unclaimed, not owned or your own bed without spawn point setting.

Allows you to sleep in front of the fire.

After you have "Resting" buff for set configurable amount of time (default 20 seconds like for Rested buff) you can interact with fireplace to get to sleep. You should be sitting on the floor or furniture.

Uses current ingame hotkey for alternative action. 

For PC it's Left shift. Doesn't mess with bed or fireplace behavior. Doesn't show hotkey hint if you can sleep as usual.

## Installation (manual)
