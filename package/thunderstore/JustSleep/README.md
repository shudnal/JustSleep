# JustSleep
Valheim mod for sleeping in not owned beds.

## Features
Allows you to sleep in unclaimed, not owned or your own bed without spawn point setting.

Uses current ingame hotkey for alternative action. 
Currently it's Left shift. Doesn't mess with usual bed behavior. Doesn't show hotkey hint if you can sleep as usual.

It should not mess with other mods

## Installation (manual)
extract JustSleep.dll to your BepInEx\Plugins\ folder.
